# FreeEnergyNoneqTI
This notebook demonstrates the application of nonequilibrium techniques for the calculation of free energies of solids using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The methods implemented here are based on **Frenkel-Ladd**, and **Reversible-scaling** thermodynamic paths. 

Calculations presented here are based on https://github.com/jan-janssen/pyiron-free-energy where classes for Frenkel-Ladd and Reversible Scaling are developed and tested within the pyiron package.

The main work intriduced here is based on reproducing the results of https://DOI.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.10.050.
